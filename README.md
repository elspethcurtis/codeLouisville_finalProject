My project for Code Louisville is the beginning of a website to hold my favorite recipes. I have written recipe categories in HTML and used JavaScript to store and display the recipes in each category when a particular category is clicked. 

Currently, I have added one placeholder page link (the coming_soon.html page) for the recipes themselves. Instead of creating numerous HTML pages for every different recipe, I hope to add this feature in the future when I take FullStack JavaScript and can do it in a more efficient manner.
